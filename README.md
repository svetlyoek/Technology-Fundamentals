The "Technology Fundamentals" course extends the up-to-date beginnings of program code writing from the "Programming Basics" course and introduces basic programming techniques and tools beyond the writing of simple programming constructs.
Along with programming techniques, the course develops algorithmic thinking and builds problem solving skills by working on hundreds of practical exercises. All exercise and home tasks are evaluated in real time with the automated SofUni online judging system.
The training methodology is extremely practical. The studied material is presented with a basic theory, with numerous examples and an enormous amount of practical tasks with increasing difficulty and upgrading one after the other, with detailed instructions. Practical work in class with active support of teachers and assistants (or home for online students) is over 70%.
During the course, the participants will learn about the basics of Web development that will be studied through practical understanding of the way the web applications work in the chosen professional field and will get an idea of the entire training program which is to be obtained until obtaining a diploma for software engineer. The course ends with the development of a practical project by the students.
